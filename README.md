# Assembly Linker
A low-level LC2K toolchain in C for a simplified ARM-like architecture, featuring a modular assembler and linker system that enables multi-file program support. Includes a custom object file format with symbol and relocation tables, cross-file label resolution, and a linker that generates final machine codeâ€”highlighting instruction encoding, file format parsing, memory layout, and modular systems design.
